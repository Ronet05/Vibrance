            The main agenda of the event will be to divide the students into teams and give them a set of tasks that
            will eventually lead to one of them winning the title of “Student of the Year.” The teams would have to go
            through various rounds and obstacles to be promoted to the next set of rounds. The teams which would be
            able to manage the tasks given in the least time and most effective manner would eventually end up
            competing in the last round albeit against each other.
